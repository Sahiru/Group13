                    The Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka (VTA) was established in 1995 with the principal intention of providing skills to the rural masses of the country and, in particular, to enhance the employability of rural youth. The Authority, which falls under my purview as the Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training, has come a long way since its inception and is today the largest Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) provider in the government sector. I am pleased to note that annually approximately 30,000 youth are being trained through a network of 242 centres islandwide. The establishment of vocational training centers in rural areas has been beneficial in two ways. Namely providing greater access and opportunity for rural youth to enable them to engage in their preferred trade in their hometowns and also to fulfill the requirement of skilled personnel needed by industries located in rural areas. I am a firm believer in quality over quantity. The skilled workforce produced should be industry oriented and employable. To this end, the country’s TVET sector should maintain a close rapport with industry. One way forward is initiating Private Public partnerships to make our efforts fruitful. With the larger objective of enhancing employability in mind, I have taken a series of policy decisions to increase the quality of the training given in the TVET sector, thereby making the trainees’ acquired skills more marketable. I have made the teaching English and soft skills compulsory for all students in the TVET sector. I have also directed that all students of the VTA must be given information technology training to keep them abreast of modern technological advancements of technology. These initiatives are aimed at making our trainees more readily employable. In line with the Government’s policy objectives, I am committed to contribute towards creating 1,000,000 employment opportunities within the next 5 years. In that connection, the VTA has a very big role to play in uplifting the national economy by producing an industry oriented, readily marketable and quality skilled workforce. It is my earnest expectation that the VTA will be able to continue their commitment to assist the economic development of the country through the development of a skilled workforce, especially in rural areas, thereby also addressing issues relation to poverty alleviation and minimizing regional income disparities in the country.

                   With the recent increase of skilled employment opportunities abroad, and the developments in industries such as construction, the preference of youth to look into themselves as trained and qualified individuals has grown substantially. With the acceptance of vocational training in most fields of employment, the youth have been looking to qualify themselves in their fields of interest and in large contribute to the labour strength of this country. To address this great need the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka was established under the Sri Lanka Vocational Training Authority Act No. 12 of 1995 and since then have contributed immensely in giving training to rural youth through a cluster of national level training Institutions comprising of 07 National Vocational Training Institutions, 26 District Vocational Training Centres and with 245 Vocational Training Centres. Vocational Training Authority (VTA) of Sri Lanka being under the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training is entrusted with the main focus of giving vocational training to youth through vocational training programs, and to assist them in acquiring a recognised qualification. This will support them in obtaining employment as they are awarded the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ). Additionally VTA conducts research and development programs on vocational training, career guidance and counselling; where their focus and responsibility lies in strengthening the training arm through trainer programs in order to carry out Vocational Training Programs effectively and efficiently. Entrepreneurship plays a major role in Sri Lanka's economic development and VTA plays a large role in promoting entrepreneurship amongst our youth. While working in partnership with other Government agencies, private organizations, local and international NGO’s VTA looks to improve and shape the way it should work in order to achieve the overall vocational training objectives of the Government. VTA has clearly identified the younger generation as an asset to the country and will work to ensure that they become an asset to this country and play a strong role to shape the future of this country. Join the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka and equip yourself with the skills and training needed to gain a competitive edge in the global environment.
